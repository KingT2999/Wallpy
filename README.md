# Wallpy

A free program similar in functionality to the wallpaper engine. At the moment, it can only put videos on the desktop.

Be sure to unzip mpv.rar after downloading the entire repository. I put it in the archive because the file is over 25 MB and I had to compress it.

To run the program, you need to write the path to the video that you want to put on the desktop in the command line after "python wallpy.py".
For convenience, I have created a "video" folder in which you can store video files.

`python wallpy.py {Path to video}`

If you need to remove video from the desktop, just write "Ðš" instead of the path to the video.
